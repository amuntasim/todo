Assignment
========================

In the professional world, you'll often be working on an existing codebase. What to do when you find yourself with someone else's code as part of your own job duties? How can you improve it?

Taking over projects seamlessly and quickly is a skill that will come in handy!

Executing a project from start to finish is "easy" (well, relatively speaking). You end up with intimate knowledge of the project and all its quirks. However, it can be much more difficult to take over someone else's work, especially when there are no existing tests ‚Äî but there are existing bugs. üêõ

Here's the scenario. You just joined a small team that believes all of the world's problems are due to people being disorganized, and that more focus would solve everything. That's why they've built what they claim to be the world's best to-do app. Maybe the app itself is cool, but the code behind it is a total mess! They've brought you in to add tests to the codebase and to fix a couple lingering bugs.

In order to improve the project, you'll first need to download the project code:
